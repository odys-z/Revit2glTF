# Revit2glTF - A Revit glTF Exporter
This is currently a work in progress but the end goal is to create an open source implementation of an extensible exporter from Autodesk Revit to the glTF model format.

## Current To-Do's
- [x] Handle basic material export
- [ ] Handle textured material export
- [ ] Handle normals export
- [ ] Add toggle for exporting each element as a seperate .bin vs a single .glb.
- [x] Add element properties to extras on glTF nodes.
- [ ] Add element properties to a sqlite file referenced by glTF nodes.
